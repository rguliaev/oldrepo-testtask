=================================

Test task - simple frontend/backend application for number calculation.

Backend part:
* Multiuser web service (with tests) implemented in Scala, calculating certain fractional coefficients using rules described below.

* Use Scala framework of your choice, web service should use some JSON protocol of your choice.

* It is crucial to take into account possible concurrency issues.



Given two CSV files (called f1 and f2) containing numbers.

* Input file f1 contains input numbers

* File f2 contains intermediate results, and is updatable.

There are two WS calls:

1. Get (v1) - get v1-th result, that is, number with index v1 (indexing is zero-based) from file 2, make the following transformation and return result to the client:



if f2[v1] > 10,

then return f2[v1] - 10

else return f2[v1]



Parameters should be passed in URL.

2. Post (v2,v3,v4) does the following:



if ( f1[v3]+v2 ) < 10

then f2[v4] = f1[v3]+v2 +10

else f2[v4] = f1[v3]+v2

storing result to the file f2 (assignment here means 'storing').

Return 0 if the condition is 'true', 1 - if not.


The project should be implemented as sbt project, which may be run and tested using sbt commands.

Frontend part:

As a part of this task, a simple SPA (single-page application) should be implemented. It should contain two areas, each having controls accepting input and displaying the result WITHOUT PAGE RELOADING, using Javascript.
There should be styling of the UI, it should be done using CSS, similar to this form - http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_forms - and there should be two forms in the page .
